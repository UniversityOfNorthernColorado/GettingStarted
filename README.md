--------------------

#####Install Github#####
Click [here for a tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on how to set up Git on your computer (be sure to pick the right flavor of operating system at the top of the page!)

#####"Clone" An Existing Repository (copy repos to your local machine)#####


#####Add A New Project Repository To UNC's Github Organization#####
Use the following naming convention to name your repository: 

######[Project Family]\_[Year]\_[Project Name]######

(Project family examples include Robotics, DemoSAT, RocketSAT, Physics, Optics, etc...)

Be sure not to double up projects! If you are modifying a repo as a legacy project, be sure a timestamp is noted in the README.md and that old items are moved into a timestamped directory/folder.

#####Editing The README.md File (change the project's front page)#####
Use the [Daring Fireball Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to add formatted content through Github's website code editor (click README.md from the master branch of the UNC organization, then click the [Edit] button).
